## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?


Objective:
The purpose of this analysis is to find trends and outcomes based on fundraising goals for Louis'skickstarter campaigns.

Conclusions:
From our analysis on outcomes based on launch date, we can conclude that overall, campaigns lauched in the month of May were more significantly 
more successful than in prior months.  We can also conclude that there were a very close amount of failed campaigns and successful campaings 
in the Month of december, with a very low trend pf cancelled campaigns overall.

Regarding outcomes based on goals there is roughly a 90% sucess rate across all recorded months with a gernaral downward trend once goals 
reach the 45k-49k range, and an increase in cancelled campaigns for that same goal range.

LIMITATIONS:
There are limitations to this analysis which may be solved by more dynamic modelling or graphing. We are also not taking into account in-kind donations or donors
potential "purchasing power" so to speak relative to the finds they have available.  For example, a small business donating 5k would appear rather small in this dataset but 
could be be a large donation relative to any disposable funds the small busines has.

Other Graphs:
We could look at this data in a pie chart for the percentages of donations to see more quickly/clearly.
